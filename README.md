## marketing-automation-rails

This is a simple, proof of concept app created to show how marketing automation works from the tech side.

It's been used as an example app in my publication *[How marketing automation works](https://patrykkalinowski.com/blog/how-marketing-automation-works/)*.

It uses Ahoy gem for analytics and features segmenting users based on their activity and sending emails based on those segments.
